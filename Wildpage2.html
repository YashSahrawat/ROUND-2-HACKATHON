  <p>Illegal mining around Bannerghatta national park
    The park is threatened by multiple granite quarries operating around the national park.[12] 
    These quarries are located alarmingly close to critical elephant corridors inside the national 
    park such as Kardikal - Madeswara corridor.[13] While there is ban on mining and granite quarrying
     around the national park within a radius of One km from the boundary demarcated as "Safe Zone",
      quarries operate unabatedly. Vehicular movement is also uncontrolled. Tremors from the explosives
       used in the quarry operations are felt across a radius of at least five km adversely affecting
        elephants and other wild animals.</p>
