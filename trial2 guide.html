    <div class="h1"> <h1>History</h1></div>
    <div class="para2"><p>Bangalore, officially  known as Bengaluru, is the Capital  of the Indian State  of Karnataka.
             It has a population of over ten million, making it a megacity  and the Third populous City  
             and 5th most populous urban agglomeration in India.  It is located in Southern India  on the
              Deccan Pleteau . Its elevation is over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, the highest of 
              India’s major cities.
            
            </p><br>
        <p>A succession of South Indian dynasties, the Western Gangas, the Cholas and the Hoysalas, 
            ruled the present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under
             the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort  considered to be the foundation of modern
              Bangalore. In 1638, the Marāthās conquered and ruled Bangalore for almost 50 years, after
               which the Mughals captured and sold the city to the Mysore Kingdom of the Wadiyar dynasty
               . It was captured by the British after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who
                returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city 
                developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely
                 State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj.
                </p><br>
            <p>In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town
             grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India’s
              independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained 
              capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban 
              settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which had developed as independent
               entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru,
                was declared the official name of the city in 2006.
            </p>
        <p>
            Bangalore is sometimes referred to as the “Silicon Valley of India” (or “IT capital of India”)
             because of its role as the nation’s leading information technology (IT) exporter. Indian 
             technological organisations ISRO, Infosys, Wipro and HAL are headquartered in the city.
              A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis 
              in India. It is home to many educational and research institutions in India, such as Indian
               Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Management (Bangalore)(IIMB), National 
               Institute of Fashion Technology, Bangalore, National Institute of Design, Bangalore 
               (NID R&D Campus), National Law School of India University (NLSIU) and National Institute of
                Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence 
                organisations, such as Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics and National Aerospace 
                Laboratories are located in the city. The city also houses the Kannada film industry.
